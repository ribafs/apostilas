Introdução ao HTML Intermediário


HTML Intermediate Tutorial

Whereas the purpose of the HTML Beginner Tutorial was to teach the bare essentials, this guide adds a few nuts and bolts, which shouldn’t be particularly difficult as such, but will add a bit more to our understanding of HTML and enable us to do a few more things.
Contents

    Span and Div: The “meaningless” elements, used with CSS.
    Text: Abbreviations, Quotations, and Code
    Meta Tags: Bolting on extra information about your web page.
    Tables: rowspan and colspan: Expanding on the Tables page of the HTML Beginner Tutorial, looking at header-cells and merging cells.
    Description Lists: The forgotten lists.
    Text: Addresses, Definitions, Bi-directional, and Editorial
    Sectioning: Greater semantic structures for documents.
